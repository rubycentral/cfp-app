    Thank you for your proposal to <%= @event.name %>. Our program committee received many great talk submissions this year, and that's allowed us to put together an exciting program.

    As a result of the number of talks submitted, however, we've had to turn down a lot of excellent proposals. I'm sorry to say that we were not able to accept your submission titled, <%= @proposal.title %>, this year. This is always the toughest part knowing that we simply can't fit all the good talks in. We hope that you'll still be able to attend the conference.

    If you haven't already purchased a ticket for RubyKaigi, you will be able to get one at the "Super Early Bird" price. Please email us at 2016@rubykaigi.org for the discount.

    Thanks again for your submission as we really appreciate your willingness to share with the community.

    The <%= @event.name %> Organizers
