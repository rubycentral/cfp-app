    We have good news and bad news.  We'll start with the bad news.  We weren't able to fit your talk, <%= @proposal.title %>, into the program for <%= @event.name %>.  The good news is we have you on our waitlist.  We keep a waitlist of talks that are ready to step in if any of the accepted talks back out or get sick.

    If you are willing to be a waitlisted speaker then you need to CONFIRM by visiting the <%= @proposal.confirm_link %>.

    If you already purchased a ticket for RubyKaigi, please email us at 2016@rubykaigi.org and we will happily refund your ticket.

    TO DECLINE: if you are not interested in being a waitlisted speaker, please visit the <%= @proposal.confirm_link %>, and click the 'Withdraw Proposal' button.

    In the meantime, let us know if you have any questions. We're looking forward to seeing you!

    The <%= @event.name %> Organizers
